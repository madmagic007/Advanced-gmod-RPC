# Advanced Garry's Mod RPC

This tool adds a more detailed Discord-RPC to the game. It's a seperate program, so it works on servers without client modification.

### Versions
For the 64 and 32 bit versions of the game, you need diffrent versions of this tool. By default the 32 bit version of the game is installed. You can change this by enabling the chromium beta in steam.

### How it works
This tool works by reading the games memory. It reads the bytes at a certain address that are diffrent for the 2 versions of the game.
